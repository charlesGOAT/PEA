    <p>The goal of this company is to offer gamers the crappiest game experience ever. Our CEO, Charles-Etienne Gauthier has no shame when it comes to making atrocious games with a ton of reused assets and microtransaction. After you'll have tried one of our video games, I can guaranty you you'll never want to see anything related to gaming ever again. </p>
    
    <p>If you don't like video games, you should stay on our site. We offer crappy games
