<h4>About me👋</h4>
Hello! My name is Charles-Etienne, I am currently a second year student at Heritage College in computer science and welcome to my repository. <br/>
Hobbies include, but are not limited to:<br/>

- Reading📘
- Sports🏅
- Hanging out with friends🧑‍🤝‍🧑

I also like working out, but since covid, could not really got to the gym unfortunatly.<br/>
On the flip-side, the pandemic gave me the time to make my own video games using unity.

Since I started programming last year, I have always enjoyed it (especially C#) and look forward to making it a career.<br/>
In this repository, you will find two folders: the first folder contains some important milestones and projects I had to do during my first year at heritage. The other contains projects from my second year
