Hello! This is my ReadMe for how to run the OWASP zap test. First of all, I have included the context in the file that you can choose from. There, my user is already configured and settings for my context. 
Then, flag my assignment folder as a context and use the context I put. Then just Attack -> spider and put the user to Charles. The User will now automatically attack the website. 

Comment: The flag for anticsrf is for the first form. I removed it so the zap attack would work properly.
